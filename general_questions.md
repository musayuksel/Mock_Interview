<summary>What is the meaning of semantic HTML?</summary>
 Semantic markup isn't about performance, it's about meaning.
 In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."<br>
 Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings<br>
 Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page<br>
 Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes<br>
